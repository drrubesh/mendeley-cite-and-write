# Using Mendeley for Conducting a Systematic Review {-}

Systematic reviews demand meticulous data management to ensure comprehensive analysis and complete transparency. Mendeley, with its robust features for managing references, annotating documents, and facilitating collaboration, is an excellent tool for conducting systematic reviews, particularly when aligned with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.

## Setting Up Your Review in Mendeley {-}

### Importing References {-}

- **Gather Research from Multiple Databases**: Collect relevant research articles from various databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Utilize Mendeley’s Web Importer directly from your browser to import citations as you browse these databases.
- **Organize References in Mendeley**: Create a dedicated folder in Mendeley for your review project. Import the collected studies into this folder, ensuring all metadata is accurately captured.

### Managing Duplicates {-}

- **Detect and Remove Duplicates**: Use Mendeley’s “Check for Duplicates” feature found under the “Tools” menu to identify and merge duplicate records. It is crucial to track the number of records identified as duplicates and those deleted, as this data must be reported in the PRISMA flow chart.

## Conducting the Review {-}

### Title and Abstract Screening {-}

- **Screening Process**: Employ Mendeley to review titles and abstracts to determine their relevance to your review criteria. Use the 'Notes' feature to annotate decisions (include or exclude) and reasons for exclusion, enhancing transparency and facilitating later discussion. Move potentially relevant references to a separate folder titled "For Full Review" for easier access during the next screening phase.

### Full-Text Screening {-}

- **Detailed Evaluation**: For articles that passed the initial screening, perform a thorough full-text review. Utilize Mendeley’s PDF viewer to annotate directly on the text, highlighting key sections, and making notes on eligibility, study quality, and data for extraction.

### Data Extraction and Critical Appraisal {-}

- **Extract Data**: Implement a structured data extraction form within Mendeley Notes for uniformity. Extract critical information such as study methods, participant demographics, outcomes, and limitations.
- **Critical Appraisal**: Assess the quality of each study using standardized checklists (e.g., CASP tools). Record appraisal outcomes in Mendeley notes to ensure they are easily accessible for review.

## Collaborating Effectively {-}

### Setting Up Collaborative Groups {-}

- **Create a Group in Mendeley**: Invite co-reviewers to a shared group in Mendeley. This setup enables all members to access the project folder, contributing to screening, data extraction, and manuscript preparation.
- **Independent Review and Consensus**: Allow two or more reviewers to independently screen and appraise studies, make notes, and then discuss their findings to reach a consensus within the Mendeley platform.
- **Integrate Excel**: For resource-efficient systematic reviews, combine Mendeley with an MS Excel workbook as an alternative to more costly software like RevMan and Rayyan. This integration can significantly streamline the data management process.

### Tracking Progress and Updates {-}

- **Monitor and Sync**: Regularly sync your library to update shared folders and track the review progress. Mendeley Desktop and Web versions seamlessly integrate, ensuring all reviewers have real-time access to the latest data.

## Reporting Results {-}

- **PRISMA Flow Chart**: Utilize the data tracked in Mendeley (number of records screened, excluded, and included) to complete the PRISMA flow chart, which will be an integral part of your systematic review publication.
