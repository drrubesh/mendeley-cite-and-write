- **Metadata Extraction**: If the PDF includes embedded metadata, Mendeley will automatically extract this information. If not, manually enter the required details in the desktop app under the 'Details' section.

- **Annotation**: Double-click the PDF to open it in Mendeley. Use the annotation tools to add notes directly on the PDF. Remember to save your annotations before closing the document.
