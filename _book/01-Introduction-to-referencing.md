## Why Do We Need to Reference? {-}

Referencing is important for several reasons:

- **Acknowledgment:** To give credit to the original authors of the sources you have used.       
- **Research Traceability:** To help your readers find more information about the sources you used, enhancing the credibility and scholarly depth of your work.     
- **Support and Strength:** To bolster your arguments by citing authoritative sources, thereby providing empirical or theoretical support for your claims.        
- **Distinguishing Ideas:** To help readers distinguish between your original ideas and those derived from your sources.     
- **Highlighting Originality:** To emphasize the novelty of your research and its contribution to existing knowledge.      

Note: The terms "citation" and "reference" are often used interchangeably, though they can have specific meanings in different academic contexts.   

## What is a Citation? {-}

A citation is an acknowledgment in your text that certain material or ideas are derived from another source. It typically includes enough information for the reader to locate the source in the detailed reference list or works cited page.

## What is a Bibliography? {-}

A bibliography is a comprehensive list of all the sources you consulted during your research, regardless of whether they are cited within the work. A well-constructed bibliography should include:

- The authors' names.
- The titles of the works.
- The names and locations of the companies that published the sources.
- The publication dates.
- Page numbers, if the sources are part of multi-source volumes.

Here’s a simple example of what entries in a bibliography might look like in vancouver style

Book:

Harrison TR, Jameson JL, Longo DL, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, et al. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 20th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education; 2018.    

Journal Article:

Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, Li X, Yang B, Song J, et al. A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019. N Engl J Med. 2020;382(8):727-33.

## Common Citation Styles {-}

## APA and Vancouver {-}

- **APA (American Psychological Association)**: Preferred in psychology and the social sciences. APA uses an author-date format for in-text citations. For example: (Smith, 2020). This means you cite sources by including the author’s last name and the year of publication in parentheses.


- **Vancouver**: Commonly used in medicine and its allied sciences.Vancouver uses a numeric system where each source is assigned a number based on the order it appears in the text. The citations are indicated using numbers in parentheses or superscripts. For example: (1) or ^1.
