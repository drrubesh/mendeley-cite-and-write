# Introduction to Referencing {-}      

## Why Do We Need to Reference? {-}

Referencing is important for several reasons:

- **Acknowledgment:** To give credit to the original authors of the sources you have used.       
- **Research Traceability:** To help your readers find more information about the sources you used, enhancing the credibility and scholarly depth of your work.     
- **Support and Strength:** To bolster your arguments by citing authoritative sources, thereby providing empirical or theoretical support for your claims.        
- **Distinguishing Ideas:** To help readers distinguish between your original ideas and those derived from your sources.     
- **Highlighting Originality:** To emphasize the novelty of your research and its contribution to existing knowledge.      

Note: The terms "citation" and "reference" are often used interchangeably, though they can have specific meanings in different academic contexts.   

## What is a Citation? {-}

A citation is an acknowledgment in your text that certain material or ideas are derived from another source. It typically includes enough information for the reader to locate the source in the detailed reference list or works cited page.

## What is a Bibliography? {-}

A bibliography is a comprehensive list of all the sources you consulted during your research, regardless of whether they are cited within the work. A well-constructed bibliography should include:

- The authors' names.
- The titles of the works.
- The names and locations of the companies that published the sources.
- The publication dates.
- Page numbers, if the sources are part of multi-source volumes.

Here’s a simple example of what entries in a bibliography might look like in vancouver style

Book:

Harrison TR, Jameson JL, Longo DL, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J, Fauci AS, et al. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 20th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education; 2018.    

Journal Article:

Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, Li X, Yang B, Song J, et al. A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019. N Engl J Med. 2020;382(8):727-33.    

Website:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. COVID-19 information portal. [Internet]. Atlanta: CDC; 2020 [cited 2023 May 17]. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/COVID19    

WHO Report:

World Health Organization. Clinical management of COVID-19: interim guidance. [Internet]. Geneva: WHO; 2020 May 27 [cited 2023 May 17]. Available from: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/clinical-management-of-covid-19     

## Common Citation Styles {-}

## APA and Vancouver {-}

- **APA (American Psychological Association)**: Preferred in psychology and the social sciences. APA uses an author-date format for in-text citations. For example: (Smith, 2020). This means you cite sources by including the author’s last name and the year of publication in parentheses.


- **Vancouver**: Commonly used in medicine and its allied sciences.Vancouver uses a numeric system where each source is assigned a number based on the order it appears in the text. The citations are indicated using numbers in parentheses or superscripts. For example: (1) or ^1.

## Reference Managers {-}

## Why Use an Electronic Reference Manager? {-}

An electronic reference manager simplifies the process of collecting, managing, and citing research materials. It is an indispensable tool for modern academic writing, offering benefits such as:

- **Organisation**: Keeps your references organized and accessible.
- **Efficiency**: Automates the formatting of citations and bibliographies, saving time and reducing errors.

- **Paperpile**: Integrated primarily with Google Docs for ease of use in the Google ecosystem.
- **Endnote**: Offers robust features for managing large reference databases and PDFs. Requires subscription for complete access. 
- **Mendeley**: A combination of a reference manager and an academic social network.

## Why Choose Mendeley? {-}

**Mendeley** stands out due to its dual functionality as both a reference manager and an academic collaboration network. Here are some reasons to choose Mendeley for your academic work:

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Word and other word processors for citation management.

# Using Mendeley for Conducting a Systematic Review {-}

Systematic reviews demand meticulous data management to ensure comprehensive analysis and complete transparency. Mendeley, with its robust features for managing references, annotating documents, and facilitating collaboration, is an excellent tool for conducting systematic reviews, particularly when aligned with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.

## Setting Up Your Review in Mendeley {-}

### Importing References {-}

- **Gather Research from Multiple Databases**: Collect relevant research articles from various databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Utilize Mendeley’s Web Importer directly from your browser to import citations as you browse these databases.
- **Organize References in Mendeley**: Create a dedicated folder in Mendeley for your review project. Import the collected studies into this folder, ensuring all metadata is accurately captured.

### Managing Duplicates {-}

- **Detect and Remove Duplicates**: Use Mendeley’s “Check for Duplicates” feature found under the “Tools” menu to identify and merge duplicate records. It is crucial to track the number of records identified as duplicates and those deleted, as this data must be reported in the PRISMA flow chart.

## Conducting the Review {-}

### Title and Abstract Screening {-}

- **Screening Process**: Employ Mendeley to review titles and abstracts to determine their relevance to your review criteria. Use the 'Notes' feature to annotate decisions (include or exclude) and reasons for exclusion, enhancing transparency and facilitating later discussion. Move potentially relevant references to a separate folder titled "For Full Review" for easier access during the next screening phase.

### Full-Text Screening {-}

- **Detailed Evaluation**: For articles that passed the initial screening, perform a thorough full-text review. Utilize Mendeley’s PDF viewer to annotate directly on the text, highlighting key sections, and making notes on eligibility, study quality, and data for extraction.

### Data Extraction and Critical Appraisal {-}

- **Extract Data**: Implement a structured data extraction form within Mendeley Notes for uniformity. Extract critical information such as study methods, participant demographics, outcomes, and limitations.
- **Critical Appraisal**: Assess the quality of each study using standardized checklists (e.g., CASP tools). Record appraisal outcomes in Mendeley notes to ensure they are easily accessible for review.

## Collaborating Effectively {-}

### Setting Up Collaborative Groups {-}

- **Create a Group in Mendeley**: Invite co-reviewers to a shared group in Mendeley. This setup enables all members to access the project folder, contributing to screening, data extraction, and manuscript preparation.
- **Independent Review and Consensus**: Allow two or more reviewers to independently screen and appraise studies, make notes, and then discuss their findings to reach a consensus within the Mendeley platform.
- **Integrate Excel**: For resource-efficient systematic reviews, combine Mendeley with an MS Excel workbook as an alternative to more costly software like RevMan and Rayyan. This integration can significantly streamline the data management process.

### Tracking Progress and Updates {-}

- **Monitor and Sync**: Regularly sync your library to update shared folders and track the review progress. Mendeley Desktop and Web versions seamlessly integrate, ensuring all reviewers have real-time access to the latest data.

## Reporting Results {-}

- **PRISMA Flow Chart**: Utilize the data tracked in Mendeley (number of records screened, excluded, and included) to complete the PRISMA flow chart, which will be an integral part of your systematic review publication.
